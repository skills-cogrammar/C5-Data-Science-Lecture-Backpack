Both devices were operated under the same conditions. I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn't work I tried putting another set in, same problem. I then placed Energizer batteries into the devices, and they work. I essentially bought 12 working batteries that lasted less than a month in devices that used them in such a manner they would last 12x as long. Never purchasing Amazon batteries again.

      "text : I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof) - NEGATIVE\n",

I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good.

I've used them in a variety of devices portable LED lights that I utilize maybe once every two months for events, in a battery-operated soap-dispenser, in tap lights in a closet/hallway, in toys... In the soap-dispenser, they lasted three weeks. I thought the dispenser must be faulty, switched them out. Next set of these batteries lasted a week. In the LED lights, the batteries lasted five hours. Less in the toys and tap lights. At this rate, I'll have used the whole box of 20 batteries in less than 6 months. What a wasteful, useless product! - NEGATIVE\n",

      "text : They're batteries. They're cheaper than Wal-Mart. What more could you want I don't have stats on whether they last longer than Duracell or Energizer, but at this price I don't think it really matters. The brand Amazon Basics has tons of useful stuff all the way from batteries to laptop bags and more. It seems like Amazon wasn't enough of a household name so they're trying to make it so everything in your house has the Amazon name on it, but I ain't mad let them take over.

She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system.

I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven't had any issues with it..

      "text : I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one. - NEGATIVE\n",

Between the one year of programming and the two years of warranty, I don't think there is a better tablet on the market for children. Excellent product and it works very well with the children at what ever level they are at. - POSITIVE\n",

      "text : I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. To note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest. - NEGATIVE\n",

      "text : I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7\" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet. - NEGATIVE\n",

      "text : Got this tablet to replace the nabi my 4 yr old daughter had. I picked this tablet because of its 2 yr no questions asked return policy, If u have kids you know they always find away to break spill or the software glitches. So far this tablet works great it's way faster then the nabi was its easy for my 4 yr old to work and I can set time limits and what she can do it also shows me what she uses and for how long each day. The tablet is light and easy for her to hold and the bumper has worked good when it has been dropped. Has a great selection of free apps books and games for a full year after that its $4.99 a month. My 8 yr old wants one now and she currently has a ipad but says the amazon works better and she loves the selection of books. I would recommend this tablet - POSITIVE\n",

      "text : Needed to replace the old Nook. Looked at the fire and was a little unsure. At this price though you get more than what you pay for. I travel alot for work and this has earned it's place in my travel bag. Well most of the time it's actually in my back pocket so I have quick access to it to get some reading done. For anything to be carried on my person during travel is high praise from me because that means it has value and importance. - POSITIVE\n",
      "text : These batteries are ok for the price. They don't last very long in a device compared to other brand name batteries. There is a difference! I wouldn't buy them again. - POSITIVE\n",

      "text : My wife and I wanted our children to still enjoy the feeling of having an \"iPad\", so we got the Amazon Fire Kids edition. It has been awesome. I love the way you can set limits on the tablet so they're not glued to it all day long. Kids mode is extremely beneficial. - POSITIVE\n",
      "text : I love these batteries. They are another excellent addition to Amazon's much appreciated line of Basics. I highly recommend them - I have used just about all of the available sizes I think by now, and I've yet to hit a dud. Much cheaper than the popular copper-top which used to be my go-to battery.GET THEM! :-) - POSITIVE\n",

      "text : I bout this item for my granddaughter for Christmas. It has games that she enjoys playing The case protects the device very well. It also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. As she gets older you can change that. It is bigger than an iPod and smaller than an iPad and has a better price. Since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps - POSITIVE\n",

      "text : My 10yr old stepdaughter wanted a camera, but after Christmas, Best Buy was out of stock. We thought this was a good alternative (she gets $ from her grandparents, so it was her purchase) since she broke her old tablet as well. Due to her being behind 2yrs in school, we set a 2 hr limit - meaning she had to read or do other educational games for 2 hours before being able to play on it. We also set a max time so she wouldn't spend all day. It was REALLY easy to set this up & I wish it was this simple on our other kids' electronics. So, yes I had an alterior motive for moving her to an educational tablet in lieu of a camera, but some kids refuse to get outdoors. So far, a great buy! - NEGATIVE\n",
      "text : GREAT! - POSITIVE\n",
      "text : they are batteries and they make my battery powered stuff work so im not sure how this could get a low rating. for the price well worth it. that said they don't seem to last quite as long as other name brands. - NEGATIVE\n",

I loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such. Its portable its got clean and crisp sound. It also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected. Its very easy to use i have no complants about this speaker at all - POSITIVE\n",

      "text : Purchased this tablet for my grandson who is two years old. He loved it!. But the power cord and the tablet hook up didn't work very long. I will be taking it back for a replacement. As long as the connection stays snug it's a great tablet. - NEGATIVE\n",
      "text : Work great, and at an affordable price. - POSITIVE\n",
      "text : People kept saying, They're as good as Duracell but I didn't believe it until I tried them myself. - NEGATIVE\n",
      "text : This is a great tablet for younger users (i'd say up to 10 years old). Performance is not on par with higher end tablets, but it is fine for younger children. The best thing about this tablet is that it comes with a 2 year no questions asked replacement warranty. This even covers cracked screens. My kids 3, 5, and 8 use these tablets on long trips. They are able to play all of their favorite games. The Amazon play store underground is excellent. It has many of their favorite games, but in app purchases are included for those games.Pros: 2 year no questions replacement policy. performance for younger children, amazon underground.Cons: display is not HD, battery life is not the best.Note there is a newer model of this device that was just released. It adds a higher resolution display and better battery life. However the new model costs 129.99 when not on sale.Overall I would recommend this tablet for children 10 and younger. It would be fine for an adult, but you can save yourself some money by buying the non kids edition of the tablet for less money. - NEGATIVE\n",
      "text : great money saver! will repurchase when i get near running out.these are great to have on hand (especially when it always seems that you need new batteries for everything at the same time). - POSITIVE\n",
      "text : these tablets work wonders for my needs, i didnt need a tablet to work, only for web browsing and play some games. nothing fancy, this tablet fits perfectly for that. and the price...pff perfect. ! you wont find this quality cheaper. - POSITIVE\n",
      "text : The longevity of these batteries is nothing special. They do not compare to Duracell or Energizer alkalines. After reading the reviews, I was greatly disappointed. I used them, among others, for a wall clock and remote controller. Their longevity is no better than alkaline batteries marketed and sold by Walgreen's for example. Take this into consideration before you buy them. - NEGATIVE\n",
      "text : I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies! - NEGATIVE\n",

      "text : Gift for my mom and she had no problem learning to use. - POSITIVE\n",

      "text : Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. Reads it all the time! - POSITIVE\n",
      "text : I purchased this kindle on black friday for $60.it works very well as a reader and tablet. It has good battery life and silk is a decent option for a browser. I also side loaded the nook apponto this kindle. It works as well here as it does on my nookereader. - POSITIVE\n",
      "text : For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Beats Pill for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hype. - NEGATIVE\n",
      "text : Cheaper than my local box store. No complaints. Great value - POSITIVE\n",
      "text : Cute little fire. It seems to be worth the value for all the things it can do. It could run a little faster. Nice for the buy. - POSITIVE\n",
      "text : I am very disappointed in these. I put them in my remote and within 24 hrs they are completely dead. For shame, Amazon. For shame. - NEGATIVE\n",

      "text : They're batteries. - POSITIVE\n",
      "text : I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life. - POSITIVE\n",
      "text : Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kids and two of them are twin toddlers. Battery operated toys save your sanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basics to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Get them on subscription. - POSITIVE\n",

      "text : Great price - POSITIVE\n",
      "text : I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic. - POSITIVE\n"
