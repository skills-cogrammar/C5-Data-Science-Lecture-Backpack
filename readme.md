## C5 Data Science Lecture Backpack

Welcome to the C5 Data Science Lecture Backpack. This is where you will be able to find all the content covered in each session every week.

To locate the content you are looking for, you can use the session the content was covered in as a reference. Each type of session has a directory in each Week containing the content of that session.

For example the content that has been covered in Week 1 during the theory sessions will be located in the Theory directory which resides in the Week 1 directory. The only exceptions are the Portfolio and Foundational Sessions, which have dedicated folders.
