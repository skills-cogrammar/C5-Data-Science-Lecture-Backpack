    "# Background \n",
    "Databases are an important part of both Software Engineering and Data Science as they provide a solid option for storing and managing our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike text file or CSV file, databases allow us to more security store our data and provide measures to make sure that our data is consistent (when talking about tabular and SQL databases). \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of all of the possible points of failure when storing your data in a file, the file can easily be read, modified and deleted without any special tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of their many issues, text files are not a good or scaleable solution for storing data, this is where databases come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "### As Software engineers\n",
    "\n",
    "As a software engineer, you want to make sure that the data you are working with is consistent, easy to access for those who should be able to access it and inaccessible for those who should not be able to access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a software engineer, you will mainly use database to store information that needs to be accessible whenever the application is run. Databases can be used for storing customer details if you are creating an e-commerce site, posts if you are creating a social media application and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a developer in the modern day, you will mainly be connecting your applications to cloud based databases solutions allowing the same information to be shared between different instances of the same application, but as we will see in this notebook, this is not too different from connecting to a database locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, there are instances where you might need to work with databases, you might be performing queries on large amounts of data and need to query multiple different tables at the same time for your analysis, in this case, using SQL would be the best option (with read access only), but this is out of scope for what we want to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another instance would be when you are working on a team where all of the data that needs to be analyzed is stored in a database and there is no API for getting data, or any API that accesses data doesn't fit your ever-changing needs. Connecting directly to the database (with read access only) would be the best choice to allow you to perform the operations that you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist working with SQL databases in particular, you can trust that the data you are working with is mostly clean and error free assuming that the data engineers have set up the right measures to ensure data integrity, reducing the amount of work that you would need to do."

    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be going through the different ways we can interact with SQL within our Python environment. We will mainly focus on using the built in sqlite3 module in Python, but we will also take a look at how we can connect to local or cloud databases within Python, and how we can access databases in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be going over tabular databases that make use of SQL for querying the data stored in the database for this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating connections to No-SQL databases would have a similar setup process (with different modules) but would make use of different approaches for querying and working with the data."

    "# SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will go over SQLite and how to use it in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is a good option to get us started with working with databases in our applications as it comes standard with Python so there is no need to install any additional packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Side note, SQLite also comes installed on Android devices, so most applications that stored data locally on your device are using SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggest, SQLite is a lightweight SQL database. Unlike other SQL databases, it does not require a server to run making the install size very small at about 500kbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than the size and lack of complex configuration required to use SQLite, all of it’s benefits other benefits are also weaknesses when compared to other SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits (Weaknesses)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-contained** - SQLite databases run locally on the machine that will directly access the database, the database is usually stored in the project file and used by a single application. This makes it a good solution for storing local data in a more managed way than using files, but means that sharing data between applications is not possible, (unless you get creative).\n",
    "- **Serverless** - Most databases require servers to run, these usually take up a lot of resources and need to be physically running in order to handle requests, but SQLite basically works like a file where you just need to connect to the database whenever you want and it will work. The lack of a server means that SQLite can not be hosted on a cloud platform and used by different applications."

    "# Connecting Other Databases \n",
    "As mentioned earlier, SQLite is not the best choice when it comes to working with large-scale applications, as you can see in the examples, SQLite creates the database file within the project file similar to a text file, the only difference is that you can’t open the file and view the data… without the correct tools of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is still a good option when you want to store user-specific data locally, but beyond that, it’s not a good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any project that might need to have a hosted database or require a more robust solution, it’s best to use a more powerful database solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to working with SQL, there are 3 databases that stand out, SQL Server, PostgreSQL and MySQL\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to one of these databases, the first thing you will need is a database service. There are 3 options that I can think of, each has its pros and cons so it’ll be up to you to choose the right option for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing the database locally** \n",
    "\n",
    "This is probably the most common approach if you want to work with a certain database tool very often, it allows you to turn your computer into a database server\n",
    "\n",
    "pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can connect to it anytime you want\n",
    "- Good for working offline\n",
    "- Most database services will come with dedicated tools for interacting with the database, so that’s cool\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very complicated to set up\n",
    "- Probably leaves you stuck working with a single database since you won’t want to configure another one\n",
    "- The database service will always be running in the background\n",
    "\n",
    "**Installing through docker**\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is a really good tool that allows you to run services locally, but in an isolated environment making it really easy to build and teardown systems at a wim.\n",
    "\n",
    "pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lets you store database images that can be run when required, and destroyed when not needed, this encourages you to test out different databases without worrying about them always running in the background\n",
    "- Limited database setup, the databases are mostly set up for you.\n",
    "- More flexible as you can work on different machines, you can be sure that all of the machines you build on are using the same version of a database and there will be no compatibility issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning curve, but the process of setting up docker and getting a database image is still quicker than installing a database locally\n",
    "- Image size, some images can be gigabytes large\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud Solution** \n",
    "\n",
    "The other option is to set up a database in the cloud and connect to it in your application. If you are using a low-end machine but still want to use a powerful database, this is a really good workaround.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Great option for low-spec machines\n",
    "- Super easy to set up when working with the right provider\n",
    "- Less setup time when working on more than 1 machine, the only thing you need to setup is the credentials (because we should never store credentials when pushing our code to a repository)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limited free options, SQL Server for example usually requires paid hosting (and a paid license)\n",
    "- You have to work online all of the time, this can be limiting when the network is bad\n"

    "## Connecting to an ORM \n",
    "\n",
    "As software engineers, we're somewhat alergic to SQL and working directly with databases. This is where ORMs come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) is a tool that allows you to map you Python classes to database tables. ORMs allow you to perform all of the database operations that you need to perform without having to write any SQL which can be really convenient especially if your applications are OOP, when you build an OOP application that connects to a database, you need to create classes that map to the tables, connecting to SQL directly adds more operations that you need to perform as you would need to write the statement for performing CRUD operations. With an ORM, you just need to plug the existing model classes in your application to the ORM and you're ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Python Frameworks like Django will include their own built in ORMs, but one popular ORM that you can use for any Python project is `sqlalchemy` which can be installed using `pip install sqlalchemy`"
