    "\n",
    "The ease of applying each of the principles depends on the language you are using, some languages like Java and C# are built around these concepts and make them really easy to implement, where a language like Python or JavaScript would require more thought to implement these techniques.\n",

    "Methods from data types and data structures give us a good view of how encapsulation works, one example would be the `remove()` method from the `list` class.\n",
    "You might have used the `remove()` method to delete an item from a position, but have you ever thought of what this method actually does in order to be able to delete the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever thought of how you are still able to access index `1` after performing `my_list.remove(1)`. This is the point of encapsulation, it allows the user of the method to just use the method knowing that they will get their required output and not really have to know about the inner workings of the method."
